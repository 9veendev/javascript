        </header>
        
        <h2>1.difference between var,let and const</h2>
        <p><B>var</B> variables can be globally scoped or function scoped.while <B>let and const</b> variables are block scoped.
            <B>var</B> variables are updated and re-declared with in it's scope. <B>let</B> variables are updated and not re-declarable.and <b>const</b> variables are not updated and nor re-declared in it's scope. </p>
        <h2>2.Closure function</h2>
        <p><b>Closure</b> means it is a inner function and it's always access the vars and parameters of it's outer function ,
            even after the outer function has returned.</p>
        <h2>3.Hoisting</h2>
        <p><b>Hoisting</b> is java script's default behaviour of moving all the variables to the top of the current scope.</p>
        <h2>4.difference between == and ===</h2>
        <p>in java script <b>==</b> is used for comparing the two variables.but it ignores the data type of a variable. and <b>===</b> is used to comparing the two variables.
            and also this operator is checks the data type and value of a two variables. it returns true if both values and data types are same of a two variables.
        </p>
        <h2>5.Call and apply method</h2>
        <P><b>call and apply</b> are similar- they invoke a f.unction with a specified this content and optional orguments.
            the only differnce between call and apply methode is : <b>call</b> is requires an arguments to be passed in one-by-one.and <b>apply</b> is takes the arguments in an array.
        </P>
        <h2>6.Event bubbling n event capturing</h2>
        <p>Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an <b>event</b> occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. ... With bubbling, the event is first <b>captured</b> and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
        </p>
        <h2>7.Array methods</h2>
        <p><b>arrays</b>:array is special variable.and it can holds the more than one value at time. (or) arrays are used to stored the multiple values in a single variable.<br>   
            <b>array methodes</b>: push,pop,shift,unshift,changing elements,deleting elements,splicing elements,merging elements.</p>
        <h2>8.Use strict</h2>
        <p>It's not a statement, but a literal expression,ignored by earlier versions of javascript. the purpose of <b>"Use strict"</b> is to indicate that code should be executed in strict mode
            with strict mode, you can not, for ex: use undeclared variables. </p>
        <h2>9.ES6 features</h2>
        <p><b>ES6</b> is brought a sufficient changes to the javascript language. <br>It introduces several new <b>features</b> such as, block-scoped variables, new loop for iterating over arrays and objects, template literals, and many other enhancements to make JavaScript programming easier and more fun.</p>
        <h2>10.Arrow function</h2>
        <p> <b>Arrow functions</b> – also called “fat arrow” functions, from CoffeeScript (a transcompiled language) — are a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. ... 
            They are one-line mini functions which work much like Lambdas in other languages like C# or Python.</p>
        <h2>11.Spread operator</h2>
        <p>The <b>spread operator</b> is a new addition to the set of operators in JavaScript ES6. It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements. The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects. Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability.</p>
        <h2>12.Primitive and non primitive data types </h2>
        <p><b>primitive data types:</b> int,character,flot,boolean,long,short,bytes,double.<br>
           <b>non-primitive data types:</b> strings,class,arrays,interfaces.</p>
